        A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza
        Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte
        commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a
        pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different
        pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the
        colors of the Italian flag â€” red (tomato), green (basil), and white
        (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the
        Queen, although later research cast doubt on this legend. An official
        letter of recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remains on
        display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi. Pizza was
        brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late
        nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants
        concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in 1905.
        Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign,
        who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for
        pizza in particular.
